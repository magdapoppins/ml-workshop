# Machine Learning Design Workshop Materials
These materials are based on and extend [OS LevelUP Koodarit](https://oslevelupkoodarit.github.io/) data science materials. The datasets contained are collected from Kaggle and can be found from the links below.

**Getting Started:** Download this folder and all it's contents. You need Anaconda with Python 3. Open the `.ipynb`-files in Jupyter Notebook through Anaconda. You can print the canvases on paper size A3 and the cards on double sided A4, so that the descriptions go on the other side of the algorithm names.

## Algorithm Cards
- Support the Workshop Canvas excercise

## Workshop Canvases
- Print on A3
- 4 challenges

## Jupyter Worksheets
This kit contains two sample worksheets which you can download and work with. The first one, Starter Worksheet, contains a short intro to statistics and datasets in Python using Scikit Learn and Pandas. The second example contains a walkthrough of clustering.
